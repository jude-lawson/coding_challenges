### FizzBuzz

FizzBuzz is a common coding challenge that involves branch logic and data type manipulation. The idea is as follows:

Given a range of consecutive integers print the range of integers given the following constraints:

- If the integer is divisible by 3, print 'Fizz' instead of the integer.
- If the integer is divisible by 5, print 'Buzz' instead of the integer.
- If the integer is divisible by 3 and 5, print 'FizzBuzz' instead of the integer.
- If none of the above, simply print the integer.

Implement a program that takes in the user input as the maximum value in the range and outputs the list of numbers-FizzBuzz'ed.
