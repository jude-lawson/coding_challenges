# Coding Challenges

## Summary
A collection of coding challenges to be implemented in multiple languages.

## Challenges

### FizzBuzz

FizzBuzz is a common coding challenge that involves branch logic and data type manipulation. The idea is as follows:

Given a range of consecutive integers print the range of integers given the following constraints:

- If the integer is divisible by 3, print 'Fizz' instead of the integer.
- If the integer is divisible by 5, print 'Buzz' instead of the integer.
- If the integer is divisible by 3 and 5, print 'FizzBuzz' instead of the integer.
- If none of the above, simply print the integer.

Implement a program that takes in the user input as the maximum value in the range and outputs the list of numbers-FizzBuzz'ed.

### Is It Prime?

Given an integer, determine whether or not the integer is a prime number (indivisible) by any number but itself.

- Prompt the user for input
- Check that it is an integer
- Determine if it's prime
- Print out 'Prime' or 'Not Prime'
